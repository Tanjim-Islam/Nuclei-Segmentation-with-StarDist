# Nuclei Segmentation with StarDist

This repository contains a pipeline for segmenting nuclei in microscopy images using the StarDist model. The pipeline includes preprocessing of the input images, segmentation with the StarDist model, and post-processing to refine the segmentation results. The output includes visualizations of the original and segmented images.

## Overview
Nuclei segmentation is a crucial task in biomedical image analysis. This project leverages the StarDist model, which uses star-convex shapes to efficiently segment nuclei. The pipeline involves:
1. Preprocessing the images to enhance contrast and reduce noise.
2. Using the StarDist model to predict instances of nuclei.
3. Post-processing the segmentation results to refine and improve the accuracy.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```
pip install stardist
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install tensorflow
pip install tqdm
pip install scikit-image
```

## Usage
- Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tanjim-Islam/Nuclei-Segmentation-with-StarDist.git
cd nuclei-segmentation-stardist
```
- Place your images in the "original" folder. Ensure the images are in .tif format.
- Run the code
- View the results in "segmented" folder

## Results

Here is an example of the output generated by the pipeline:
